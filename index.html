    <h1><font color="33FFBC">Podcasts: Part One</font></h1>
    <h2><i><font color="33ADFF">Homecoming</font></i></h2>
    <h3><font color="C233FF">Summary</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I listen to a solid six or seven different podcasts on a regular basis every week and, I have to say, I have never listened to one quite like <i>Homecoming</i>. My immediate thought when listening to <i>Homecoming</i> was that it sounded like an audiobook mixed with the drama of and dialogue of a television show. It reminded me a bit of the <i>Modern Love</i> podcast that I listen to, wherein a celebrity reads an essay about love with the help of background sound effects. However, the major difference is that <i>Homecoming</i> revolves around the telling of a story through minor sound effect glimpses, so in that regard it reminds me a bit of <i>Law and Order</i></li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="C233FF">Structure</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>In <i>Homecoming</i>, the talking is being done by a set of characters and is typically captured in the form of a telephone conversation, an audio recording of a therapy session, or a voice recording. While the speakers are constantly changing throughout, the main speaker is a woman named Heidi, who has a mysterious past working alongside soldiers returning from war. </li>
    <li>The podcast is clearly scripted as it sounds like a set of audio recordings from a television show or movie. The podcast also employs very well-known actors, who seem to be playing scripted characters. </li>
    <li>While the show is more of a narrative than a collection of interviews, the majority of the audio recordings that are employed in the narrative of the podcast are interviews. So, while the podcast itself if not interview based it does use interviews, of a sort, to tell the narrative story. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="C233FF">Sound Effects</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The podcast really doesnâ€™t employ the use of music; however, sound effects play a major role throughout. You can often hear the crackling of a cell phone conversation and the use of background noises to allow the listener to picture the setting of a particular conversation. Ultimately, <i>Homecoming</i> does a very solid job of incorporating the use of many unique sound effects to help tell an oral story. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2><i><font color="33ADFF">Radiolab</font></i></h2>
    <h3><font color="C233FF">Summary</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Upon first listen, <i>Radiolab</i> sounded much more like a typical Podcast and it felt sort of like a lot of the other popular NPR podcasts. One of my favorite podcasts is an NPR podcast called <i>How I Built This</i> which details how an entrepreneur built his or her business. Similar to <i>How I Built This</i>, <i>Radiolab</i> consists of a collection of interviews revolving around a specific subject and is mainly based around conversational interviews. I was pleasantly surprised at just how interesting and varied the hosts were able to make the simple subject of colors, and this is definitely the type of podcast that I would continue to listen to. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="C233FF">Structure</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The talking in <i>Radiolab</i> is being done by a set of interviewers with a set of expert interviewees. The podcast is also a mix of interviews and previously recorded segments with interviewees, which makes for a unique mixture of content. </li>
        <li><i>Radiolab</i> is far less scripted than <i>Homecoming</i>, which was entirely scripted, and relies on more freelance conversations. However, the podcast does have scripted moments, in that several of the interview questions typically seem scripted and the pre-recorded research collection segments that they employ in the podcast are also scripted. </li>
        <li><i>Radiolab</i> is based almost solely around interviews rather than narratives; however, rather than just consisting of one interview, the podcast contains several different interviews that focus on several unique subjects within the realm of the larger topic. Also, the podcast does contain pre-recorded segments of research collection, so, it is not totally dependent on interviews </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><font color="C233FF">Sound Effects</font></h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Whereas <i>Homecoming</i> did not employ the use of music too any serious degree, <i>Radiolab</i> relies heavily on the use of both music and sound effects. In one particular segment they even deployed the use of a choir to highlight the colors of the rainbow. It was very effective. The podcast also employed the use of themed music which was very effective and entertaining. </li>
    </ul>
